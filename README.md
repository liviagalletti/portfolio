## Health Metrics Calculator (Python)

### Overview
This Python script calculates various health metrics based on user input such as gender, birthdate, weight, and height. It provides the user with essential health information including age, body mass index (BMI), and basal metabolic rate (BMR).

### Code Explanation

#### Main Function (`main()`):
- **User Input**: Prompts the user to input their gender, birthdate, weight, and height.
- **Metric Calculation**: Calls helper functions to compute age, convert weight and height units, calculate BMI, and BMR.
- **Output**: Displays the calculated metrics including age, weight (in kilograms), height (in centimeters), BMI, and BMR.

#### Helper Functions:
- `compute_age(birth_str)`: Calculates the user's age based on their birthdate.
- `kg_from_lb(pounds)`: Converts weight from U.S. pounds to kilograms.
- `cm_from_in(inches)`: Converts height from U.S. inches to centimeters.
- `body_mass_index(weight, height)`: Calculates the user's BMI.
- `basal_metabolic_rate(gender, weight, height, age)`: Calculates the user's BMR based on gender, weight, height, and age.

# MySQL Workbench (SQL)

## Description
The provided SQL script is generated by MySQL Workbench Forward Engineering. It creates a database schema named `University` and several tables related to university administration, such as colleges, departments, courses, faculty, students, enrollment, and sections.

## Key Features
- **Schema Creation**: Defines a database schema named `University`.
- **Table Creation**: Creates tables for colleges, departments, courses, faculty, students, enrollment, and sections, along with their respective attributes and relationships.
- **Foreign Key Constraints**: Establishes foreign key constraints to maintain data integrity among related tables.
- **Insertion of Sample Data**: Inserts sample data into the tables to demonstrate the structure and functionality of the database.

## Usage
The SQL script can be executed in a MySQL database management system (DBMS) such as MySQL Workbench. It will create the `University` schema and populate it with sample data.
